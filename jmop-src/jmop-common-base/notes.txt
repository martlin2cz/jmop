possibilities:
	- firePropertyChanged(propertyName, oldValue, newValue):
 		- list of properties, constants, enums, strings?
 		- values as object?
 		- add/remove?
 		- need to keep track fo that
 	
 	- tons of setX(newValue):
 		- nah
 		- break back into the Bundles/Playlists/Tracks Musicbase?
 			- naah
 		
 	- updateX(name, description, duration, tracks, author, ...):
 		- uurgh ...
 		- will look like: x.updateX(newName, x.getDedscription(), x.getDuration(), x.getTracks(), x.getAuthor(), ...)
 		- however, would avoid unnecessary saves in cases like x.setName, x.setDescription, x.markPlayed
 		
 
 forther issues:
 	- move playlist:
 		- move also its tracks?
 			- what if another playlists references them?
 		- or copy them?
 		- or leave it as empty ... skeleton?
 		
 	- when renamed/removed track:
 		- don't forget to update/save all its playlists as well, i guess
